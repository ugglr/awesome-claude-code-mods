# Awesome Claude Code Mods [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A community list of Claude Code mods (function hooks) for **Claude Code 2.1.287+**. A mod is a plugin that uses JavaScript or TypeScript functions to change Claude Code's interface or behavior. [Browse the catalogue](https://mods.aidojo.si/).

Add a browser beside your conversation, keep usage in view, or check a command before it runs. Install a community mod or [ask Claude to build one](https://claude.dev/blog/getting-started-with-claude-code-mods/#the-shortcut-let-claude-build-it).

This community catalogue scans public GitHub repositories and records what Claude's validator reports each mod can read, write, run or send over the network. It is an independent scan, not an official Anthropic directory.

## Use mods

Use **Claude Code 2.1.287 or later**. Mods are enabled by default; no feature flag is needed. Follow the chosen mod's installation instructions, or try a local plugin with `claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/plugin`.

Read the mod's source and access details before installing. Validation checks the source without running the mod; it does not guarantee safe behavior or runtime compatibility.

## Every mod the scanner found

The **[full catalogue](catalogue.md#every-mod-the-scanner-found)** includes each discovered mod's description, access, observed events and validation result. [Built-in mods](catalogue.md#built-into-claude-code) are listed separately. [Search and filter the collection on the website](https://mods.aidojo.si/#directory).

## How the scan works

A scheduled scan searches GitHub for mod repositories, checks their plugin source with `claude plugin validate`, and proposes updates for review. The website and catalogue use the same scan data. Published results change when the update PR is merged.

Merging a seed submission also starts a separate publication check. New repositories with passing checks appear automatically after their generated update is merged by the workflow and the website deploys. Existing listings stay unchanged. A seed with validation failures or new review warnings stays unpublished and is reported in the workflow run; other seeds still publish. [Seed publication details](contributing.md#open-a-pull-request).

Discovery depends on GitHub's index and our search patterns, so a new mod may not appear immediately. A scan usually picks up a repository with the `claude-code-mod` topic within a few hours of its next push, and the mod appears once that scan's pull request is merged. [How discovery and validation work](catalogue.md#how-the-scan-works) covers access levels, warnings, retry handling and removal reviews.
